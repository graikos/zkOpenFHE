zkOpenFHE - an OpenFHE fork with (zero-knowledge) proofs of computation
=====================================

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a powerful cryptographic primitive that enables performing computations over encrypted data without having access to the secret key.
However, FHE only achieves a relatively weak security notion (IND-CPA or IND-CPA-D), which is often insufficient for real-world deployments. 

The goal of zkOpenFHE is to be a drop-in replacement for the excellent [OpenFHE](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development) library, with the additional ability to prove the correct evaluation of an FHE circuit using a (zero-knowledge) succinct non-interactive argument of knowldege ((zk)SNARK). 

To achieve this, we mirror's OpenFHE's interfaces, and augment them under the hood with automatic constraint generation and extended witness computation, using [libsnark](https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark).

## Usage
<table>
<tr>
<th>OpenFHE</th>
<th>zkOpenFHE</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```cpp


c = cryptoContext->Encrypt(secretKey, x);


c_rot = cryptoContext->EvalRotate(c, 1);

c2 = cryptoContext->EvalMultNoRelin(c, c_rot);
```
</td>
<td>

```cpp
proofSystem = LibsnarkProofSystem(cryptoContext);

c = cryptoContext->Encrypt(secretKey, x);
proofSystem.PublicInput(c);

c_rot = proofSystem->EvalRotate(c, 1);

c2 = proofSystem->EvalMultNoRelin(c, c_rot);
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

A `ProofSystem` has three modes:

* `PROOFSYSTEM_MODE_EVALUATION`: evaluate the FHE circuit, just like OpenFHE
* `PROOFSYSTEM_MODE_CONSTRAINT_GENERATION`:  generate the constraints corresponding to the FHE circuit and automatically optimize them
* `PROOFSYSTEM_MODE_WITNESS_GENERATION`: generate the extended witness for the FHE circuit, which is needed for proving correct computation
